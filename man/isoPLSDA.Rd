\title{Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis for \code{\link{IsomirDataSeq}}}
\usage{
isoPLSDA(ids, group, validation = NULL, learn = NULL, test = NULL,
 tol = 0.001, nperm = 400, refinment = FALSE, vip = 1.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{Object of class \code{\link{IsomirDataSeq}}}

\item{group}{Column name in \code{colData(ids)} to use as variable to explain.}

\item{validation}{Type of validation, either NULL or "learntest".
Default NULL.}

\item{learn}{Optional vector of indexes for a learn-set.
Only used when validation="learntest". Default NULL.}

\item{test}{Optional vector of indices for a test-set.
Only used when validation="learntest". Default NULL}

\item{tol}{Tolerance value based on maximum change of cumulative R-squared
coefficient for each additional PLS component. Default tol=0.001.}

\item{nperm}{Number of permutations to compute the PLD-DA p-value
based on R2 magnitude. Default nperm=400.}

\item{refinment}{Logical indicating whether a refined model, based on
filtering out variables with low VIP values.}

\item{vip}{Variance Importance in Projection threshold value when
a refinement process is considered. Default vip=1.2 .}
}
\value{
A \link[base:list]{base::list} with the following elements: \code{R2Matrix}
(R-squared coefficients of the PLS model),
\code{components} (of the PLS, similar to PCs in a PCA),
\code{vip} (most important isomiRs/miRNAs),
\code{group} (classification of the samples),
\code{p.value} and \code{R2PermutationVector} obtained by the permutations.

If the option \code{refinment} is set to TRUE, then the following
elements will appear:
\code{R2RefinedMatrix} and \code{componentsRefinedModel} (R-squared coefficients
of the PLS model only using the most important miRNAs/isomiRs). As well,
\code{p.valRefined} and \code{R2RefinedPermutationVector} with p-value
and R2 of the
permutations where samples were randomized. And finally,
\code{p.valRefinedFixed} and \code{R2RefinedFixedPermutationVector} with
p-value and R2 of the
permutations where miRNAs/isomiRs were randomized.
}
\description{
Use PLS-DA method with the normalized count data to detect the most
important features (miRNAs/isomiRs) that explain better
the group of samples given by the experimental design. It is a supervised
clustering method with permutations to calculate the significance
of the analysis.

\details{
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a technique specifically
appropriate for analysis of high dimensionality data sets and multicollinearity
(\emph{Perez-Enciso, 2013}). PLS-DA is a supervised method (i.e. makes use of class
labels) with the aim to provide a dimension reduction strategy in a situation
where we want to relate a binary response variable (in our case young or old
status) to a set of predictor variables. Dimensionality reduction procedure is
based on orthogonal transformations of the original variables (miRNAs/isomiRs) into a
set of linearly uncorrelated latent variables (usually termed as components)
such that maximizes the separation between the different classes in the first
few components (\emph{Xia, 2011}). We used sum of squares captured by the model (R2) as
a goodness of fit measure.

We implemented this method using the
\link[DiscriMiner:DiscriMiner-package]{DiscriMiner::DiscriMiner-package} into \code{\link[=isoPLSDA]{isoPLSDA()}} function.
The output
p-value of this function will tell about the statistical
significant of the group separation using miRNA/isomiR expression data.

Read more about the parameters related to the PLS-DA directly from
\code{\link[DiscriMiner:plsDA]{DiscriMiner::plsDA()}} function.
